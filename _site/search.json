This reconstructed data is then fed into powerful global climate models to get a complete dataset. To learn more about climate reanalyzes, click the link on the screen or in the description.  The main goal of having a reanalysis of the past six centuries is to study climate variability. This includes the effects of climate phenomena like El Niño Southern Oscillation and Monsoons or external forcings like volcanic eruptions or the rise of C02 in the atmosphere.  ClimeApp was developed in an effort to make the ModE-RA data accessible to a broader audience of researchers outside of climatology. It is designed to visualize and analyze the ModE-RA data in a user-friendly way."
